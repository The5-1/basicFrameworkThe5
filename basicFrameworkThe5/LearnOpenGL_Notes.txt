Structs in OpenGL:
Structs have a great property in C++ that their memory layout is sequential.
That is if we were to represent a struct as an array of data it would only contain
the struct's variables in sequential order which directly translates to a float 
(actually byte) array that we want for an array buffer

Vertex vertex;
vertex.Position  = glm::vec3(0.2f, 0.4f, 0.6f);
vertex.Normal    = glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
vertex.TexCoords = glm::vec2(1.0f, 0.0f);

// = [0.2f, 0.4f, 0.6f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f];
